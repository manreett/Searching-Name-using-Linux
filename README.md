# Searching-Name-using-Linux
Here user is  asked to enter the name , and then used chop to remove the last character of the string and to return that character. Then file containing phones was opened .Then split was used which  break the lines separated by spaces  .  Then put the value of first two stings into fname and lname . Further key was used to keep track that whether that name is found or not. To find the name , while loop was used with if condition to check whether the name entered matches to name in the file phones. If condition inside the loop is also checking if the argument is entered or not .Once the name is found  equal to the name in the directory then update key as 1 and print the name. The if condition was used to see if the name was found or not by using the key (that as initialized in the starting). Then file was closed at the end .
